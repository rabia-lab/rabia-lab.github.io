Our research focuses on developing scalable, data-driven methods for monitoring, understanding, and managing agricultural systems.

### Key Research Themes

**Dynamic Precision Agriculture Management (DPAM)**  
Adaptive management zones and input strategies driven by real-time crop, soil, and environmental data.

**UAV & Remote Sensing**  
Multispectral, hyperspectral, and RGB imagery for crop stress detection, phenotyping, and decision support.

**Robotics & Autonomous Systems**  
Field robotics and laser-based systems for precision weed and crop management.

**Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
Deep learning and computer vision for high-throughput phenotyping, disease detection, and trait quantification.

**Plant & Soil Phenotyping**  
Quantifying crop and soil traits across spatial and temporal scales to support sustainable management.
